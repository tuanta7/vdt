# Hibernate & JPA

## 1. What is Hibernate & JPA

- Hibernate is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java. It provides a convenient way to map Java objects to relational database tables and perform database operations using object-oriented concepts.
- Hibernate uses JDBC to interact with the database. Hibernate generates the SQL queries required to perform database operations and executes them using JDBC.
- JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification that defines a standard set of interfaces and annotations for ORM in Java applications. No, actually Hibernate was created before the Java Persistence API (JPA). **After JPA was introduced, Hibernate adapted its system to become a full-fledged JPA provider**. Hibernate is one of the popular implementations of the JPA specification.

Together, Hibernate and JPA provide a powerful and efficient way to work with databases in Java applications.
