# Java for Spring

## 1. JavaBean (Bean)

JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). It is a Java class that should follow the following conventions:

- All properties in Java Bean must be private with public getters and setter methods.
- It should implement Serializable interface.
- It should have a public "no-arg" constructor.

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Person implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private String name;

    public Person() {
        // No-argument constructor
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }


    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{name='" + name"}";
    }
}

```

JavaBeans are widely used in Java applications, particularly in frameworks like Spring and Java EE. They can be used to represent data models, form backing objects, configuration properties, and more.

## 2. Spring Bean

A Spring Bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. These beans are the backbone of a Spring application, and the container is responsible for their creation, configuration, and lifecycle management.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MySpringBean {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something in MySpringBean.");
    }
}

```

### Key Concepts

- Managed by Spring Container
- Defined in Configuration:
  - XML configuration files.
  - Java configuration classes using `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations.
  - Component scanning with annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`.
- Dependency Injection: Spring Beans can have their dependencies injected by the Spring container, promoting loose coupling.
